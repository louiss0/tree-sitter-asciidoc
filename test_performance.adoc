= Large AsciiDoc Performance Test Document
:author: Test Author  
:version: 1.0
:toc:

This document tests parser performance with a variety of AsciiDoc constructs.

== Section with Multiple Features

This section combines *bold*, _italic_, and `monospace` formatting in various ways.
We also test https://example.com[explicit links] and attribute references like {author}.

=== Subsection with Lists

Here are various list types to test performance:

* First unordered item with *bold text*
* Second item with _italic text_ 
* Third item with `code text`
  +
  Continuation paragraph with more content to parse.
  +
  ----
  Code block in continuation
  some code here
  ----

1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item with https://docs.example.com[documentation link]
3. Third ordered item

Term 1:: Definition with *formatting* and links
Term 2:: Another definition with `code` examples
Term 3:: Complex definition with [.highlight]#role spans# and {attribute} refs

=== Tables Section

Complex table with formatting:

[.striped]
.Performance Test Table
|===
| *Feature* | _Status_ | `Performance` | Description

| Sections | Working | Excellent | Hierarchical parsing works well
| 2+| Spanning cell across two columns | Performance is good  
| Lists | Working | Very Good | All list types supported
| h| Header Cell | Normal cell | Another cell with *bold*
| Formatting | Working | Excellent | Inline formatting in cells
|===

== Advanced Features Testing

=== Bibliography and References

This document references [[[knuth84]]] and [[[lamport94,LaTeX Guide]]] for testing.
Multiple references like [[[ref1]]] and [[[ref2,Second Reference]]] test parsing performance.

=== Delimited Blocks

Example block:
====
This is an example block with content.
It can contain *formatting* and other elements.
====

Listing block:
----
function parse_asciidoc() {
  // This tests code block performance
  return "success";
}
----

Quote block:
____
"The performance of this parser is excellent."
-- Test Author
____

=== Complex Inline Features

Role spans: [.big.red]#large red text# and [#special.highlight]#special content#.

UI Macros: kbd:[Ctrl+C], btn:[Save], and menu:File[New Document].

Math: stem:[sqrt(x^2 + y^2)] and latexmath:[\sum_{i=1}^n x_i].

Footnotes: This has a footnote.footnote:[This is the footnote text]

Index terms: ((primary term)) and (((primary,secondary,tertiary))).

=== Conditional Content

ifdef::draft[]
This content only appears in draft mode.
endif::[]

ifndef::final[]
This appears when not in final mode.
endif::[]

== Performance Summary

This document exercises:

* Multiple section levels (1-3)
* All inline formatting types
* All list types with continuations  
* Complex tables with spans and formatting
* Delimited blocks (example, listing, quote)
* Links (explicit and auto-detected)
* Role spans with nested formatting
* Bibliography entries
* UI macros and math formulas
* Footnotes and index terms
* Conditional processing
* Attribute references
* Metadata and block attributes

The parser should handle all these features efficiently with sub-millisecond performance for documents of this size.
