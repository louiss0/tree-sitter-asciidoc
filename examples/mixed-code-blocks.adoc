= Mixed Code Block Syntax Example
:toc:

This document demonstrates both AsciiDoc and Markdown-style code blocks.

== Markdown-Style Fenced Code Blocks

Markdown-style code blocks use three or more backticks.

=== JavaScript Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

=== Python Example

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

=== Without Language Specification

```
This is plain text without syntax highlighting.
You can still use code blocks without specifying a language.
```

=== Four Backticks (Nested)

````markdown
# This markdown contains ```code```
You can nest three backticks inside four backticks.
````

== AsciiDoc-Style Source Blocks

Traditional AsciiDoc source blocks use [source,language] with ---- delimiters.

=== JavaScript Example

[source,javascript]
----
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
----

=== Python Example

[source,python]
----
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
----

== Mixed Usage

You can use both syntaxes in the same document:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Markdown fence!")
}
```

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from AsciiDoc source block!");
}
----

== More Languages

=== TypeScript

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};
```

=== Ruby

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age
  
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
end

person = Person.new("Alice", 30)
```

=== Shell

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Count: $i"
done
```

=== SQL

```sql
SELECT 
  users.name,
  COUNT(orders.id) as order_count
FROM users
LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id
GROUP BY users.id
HAVING order_count > 5;
```

== Conclusion

Both syntaxes are fully supported with language injection for syntax highlighting!
