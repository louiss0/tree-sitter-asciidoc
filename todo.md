# TODO

## Tests that are failing
- Not run in this session.

## What bugs are present
- None confirmed; verify checklist marker parsing and document header parsing in `npx tree-sitter test`.

## What to do next
- Run `npx tree-sitter test` and delete generated logs (`parse-tree.log`, `syntax-ref-parse.log`) after a clean run.
- Confirm highlight queries still match new fields/nodes for list checkboxes and macro titles.
