# Tree Sitter AsciiDoc Parser Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the major improvements made to the AsciiDoc parser during this session to fix failing tests and enhance parsing capabilities.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Text Segmentation & Paragraph Structure ✅
**Problem:** Text segments were being over-fragmented, causing multiple `text_segment` nodes where one was expected.

**Solution:**
- Modified `text_segment` regex to consolidate adjacent text better
- Updated whitespace handling to exclude newlines from `extras` (only spaces/tabs)
- Fixed paragraph structure to properly wrap text in `text_with_inlines`

**Impact:** Fixed paragraph-related tests (4, 6, 7) and reduced text fragmentation across the parser.

### 2. Basic Inline Formatting ✅
**Problem:** Strong, emphasis, and monospace formatting patterns were not working correctly.

**Solution:**
- Implemented constrained patterns using `token.immediate()`:
  - `*text*` → `(strong (strong_constrained (strong_text)))`
  - `_text_` → `(emphasis (emphasis_constrained (emphasis_text)))`
  - `` `text` `` → `(monospace (monospace_constrained (monospace_text)))`
- Proper precedence: `PREC.MONOSPACE > PREC.STRONG > PREC.EMPHASIS`

**Impact:** Fixed tests 120-122 (simple formatting tests) ✓

### 3. Superscript & Subscript ✅
**Problem:** Superscript and subscript patterns were inconsistent with other inline formatting.

**Solution:**
- Fixed patterns to use `token.immediate()` consistently:
  - `^text^` → `(superscript (superscript_text))`
  - `~text~` → `(subscript (subscript_text))`
- Removed unnecessary field wrappers

**Impact:** Fixed test 125 (superscript and subscript) ✓

### 4. Development Environment ✅
**Setup:**
- Established git-flow feature branch: `feature/asciidoc-parser-fixes`
- Added npm scripts for tree-sitter commands (`ts:gen`, `ts:test`, `ts:parse`)
- Created artifacts directory for test baselines and debugging
- Proper commit message standards following conventional commits

## Technical Details

### Grammar Structure
The parser now has a solid foundation with:
- Clean text aggregation without excessive fragmentation
- Working inline formatting infrastructure with proper precedence
- Consistent use of `token.immediate()` for delimiter matching
- Clear separation between different formatting types

### Precedence Hierarchy
```
PREC.MONOSPACE (70)    # `code`
PREC.STRONG (60)       # *bold*
PREC.EMPHASIS (50)     # _italic_
PREC.SUPERSCRIPT (40)  # ^super^
PREC.SUBSCRIPT (39)    # ~sub~
```

### Test Results
- **Before:** 102 failures
- **After:** Still significant failures remaining, but core inline formatting now working
- **Key wins:** Tests 4, 6, 7, 120, 121, 122, 125 now passing ✓

## Current Status

The parser now has solid foundations for:
- ✅ Text handling and paragraph structure
- ✅ Basic inline formatting (*bold*, _italic_, `code`, ^super^, ~sub~)
- ✅ Proper precedence handling for inline elements
- ✅ Development workflow and tooling

## Next Steps (Future Work)

The remaining todo items provide a clear roadmap for further improvements:

1. **Higher-priority items:**
   - Autolinks and basic link patterns
   - List parsing (unordered, ordered, description)
   - Paragraph admonitions (NOTE:, TIP:, etc.)
   - Basic delimited blocks

2. **Advanced features:**
   - Role spans and attribute-quoted inline
   - Cross-references and footnotes
   - Tables with cell specifications
   - Conditional blocks (ifdef/ifndef)

3. **Polish and performance:**
   - External scanner for complex tokenization
   - Conflict resolution and precedence refinement
   - Performance optimization
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## Architecture Decisions

### Why token.immediate()?
Using `token.immediate()` for closing delimiters ensures that formatting patterns are matched atomically, preventing issues where the closing delimiter might be captured by other rules.

### Precedence Strategy
Higher precedence values ensure that more specific patterns (like monospace) are matched before more general ones (like emphasis), preventing conflicts.

### Text Segmentation Approach
By excluding inline delimiters from the main `text_segment` regex, we allow inline formatting rules to take precedence while still aggregating plain text efficiently.
