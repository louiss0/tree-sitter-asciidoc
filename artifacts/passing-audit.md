# Passing Test Expectations Audit Report

## Overview
This report audits a representative sample of passing tests across categories to verify their expectations align with AsciiDoc specification and Asciidoctor behavior.

## Audit Methodology
- Examined passing tests from multiple corpus files
- Checked structural expectations against AsciiDoc spec intent
- Cross-referenced with typical Asciidoctor parsing behavior
- Focused on edge cases and complex interactions

## Audited Categories

### 1. Sections (01_sections.txt) - ✅ CORRECT
**Files examined:** All 3 tests passing
**Findings:**
- Section hierarchy with `=`, `==`, `===`, etc. correctly parsed
- Nested section structure properly represented
- Title extraction and whitespace handling appropriate
- **No issues found**

### 2. Paragraphs (02_paragraphs.txt) - ✅ CORRECT  
**Files examined:** All 4 tests passing
**Findings:**
- Basic paragraph parsing with blank line separation
- Fake headings without space correctly parsed as paragraphs
- Mixed content handling appropriate
- **No issues found**

### 3. Attributes (03_attributes.txt) - ✅ CORRECT
**Files examined:** All 5 tests passing  
**Findings:**
- Attribute entries with `:name: value` format properly parsed
- Valueless attributes (`:name:`) handled correctly
- Invalid attribute patterns degraded to paragraphs as expected
- Mixed attributes with other content properly separated
- **No issues found**

### 4. Basic Formatting (18_basic_formatting.txt) - ✅ CORRECT
**Files examined:** All 6 tests passing
**Findings:**
- Strong (`*bold*`), emphasis (`_italic_`), monospace (`` `code` ``) correctly parsed
- Unclosed formatting treated as plain text - this is correct behavior
- Superscript (`^super^`) and subscript (`~sub~`) appropriately handled  
- Mixed formatting combinations work properly
- **No issues found**

### 5. Edge Cases (05_edge_cases.txt) - ✅ CORRECT
**Files examined:** All 5 tests passing
**Findings:**
- Indented headings properly recognized (correct per spec)
- Invalid attributes degraded to paragraphs (correct)
- Multiple blank lines handled appropriately
- Trailing spaces in headings handled correctly
- **No issues found**

### 6. Conditionals (11_conditionals.txt) - ⚠️ MIXED RESULTS
**Files examined:** 8 out of 9 tests passing, 1 failing
**Findings:**
- Basic `ifdef::`, `ifndef::`, `ifeval::` blocks correctly parsed
- Nested conditionals work properly
- Empty conditional blocks handled correctly
- **Issue identified:** "Conditional with lists and sections" test failing
  - Sections within conditionals are parsed as paragraphs instead of sections
  - This suggests the conditional block grammar doesn't properly allow all AsciiDoc content types within conditionals

## Summary of Findings

### ✅ Fully Correct Categories:
- Sections and document structure
- Basic paragraph handling  
- Attribute entries
- Basic inline formatting (emphasis, strong, monospace, super/subscript)
- Edge case handling

### ⚠️ Categories with Minor Issues:
- Conditionals: mostly correct but section parsing within conditionals needs improvement

### Key Observations:
1. **Passing tests have sound expectations** - all audited passing tests align with AsciiDoc specification
2. **No false positives identified** - no passing tests were found to have incorrect expectations
3. **Structural consistency** - test expectations follow consistent patterns and proper tree structure
4. **Appropriate error handling** - malformed constructs correctly degrade to paragraphs

## Recommendations:
1. The passing test expectations are reliable and should be preserved
2. Focus development effort on the failing tests rather than revising passing expectations
3. The one identified conditional issue (sections within conditionals) should be addressed in grammar improvements
4. Continue with the current test-driven approach using these solid expectations as a foundation

## Confidence Level: HIGH
The audited passing tests demonstrate correct understanding of AsciiDoc structure and appropriate expectations. No changes to passing test expectations are recommended at this time.
