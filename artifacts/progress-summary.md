# Tree Sitter AsciiDoc Parser - Progress Summary

## Completed Work âœ…

### 1. Successfully Fixed: Malformed Conditionals (1/21 tests fixed)

**Problem**: Malformed conditional directives like `ifdef::attr[extra content after bracket]` were being parsed as broken conditional blocks with ERROR nodes instead of plain paragraphs.

**Root Cause**: Grammar.js had overly permissive regex patterns for conditional tokens that would match any content inside brackets `[^\\]]*`, allowing malformed syntax to be recognized as conditionals.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced permissive regex patterns with strict ones requiring proper bracket syntax
- `ifdef`/`ifndef` now require empty brackets `[]` and valid attribute names before brackets  
- `ifeval` allows expression content inside brackets but still requires proper closing
- Updated test expectations to reflect that malformed conditionals should parse as paragraphs
- **Result**: Test "Malformed conditionals should be paragraphs" now passes âœ…

**Files Modified**:
- `grammar.js`: Lines 594-602 - replaced permissive regex with strict patterns
- `test/corpus/12_conditional_conflicts.txt`: Lines 88-117 - updated expected output

**Impact**: This fix prevents broken AST nodes and aligns with AsciiDoc spec where malformed directives should fall back to plain text.

### 2. Attempted: Delimited Block Fence Matching (3 failing tests)

**Problem**: Delimited blocks like listing blocks (`----`) and example blocks (`====`) are not properly matching opening and closing fences, resulting in `MISSING listing_close` errors.

**Root Cause Discovered**: Grammar-based regex tokens cannot distinguish between opening and closing fences because they use identical patterns. A line like `----` could be either an opening fence OR a closing fence - the grammar has no context to decide.

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. **External Scanner Approach**: Tried to restore stateful fence tracking but ran into token conflicts
2. **Pattern Differentiation**: Tried using exact lengths for open (`-{4}`) vs flexible for close (`-{4,}`) but this doesn't solve the fundamental ambiguity
3. **Precedence Tuning**: Fixed conflicts between openblock (`--`) and listing block (`----`) patterns

**Current Status**: Still failing. The fundamental issue is that **delimited blocks require context-aware parsing** to track which fence is open and match the corresponding closing fence.

**Correct Solution Needed**: 
- Restore proper external scanner implementation with fence state tracking
- Scanner should store fence character type and count when opening fence is found
- Scanner should only emit closing tokens when they match the currently open fence
- This requires more complex external token management than attempted

## Remaining Failing Tests (18-20 tests)

### Categories Identified:
1. **Delimited Blocks** (3 tests) - Core stateful fence matching issue
2. **Inline Formatting & Role Spans** (6 tests) - Precedence and attachment issues  
3. **Block Admonitions** (3 tests) - Metadata parsing conflicts
4. **Macro vs Formatting Precedence** (3 tests) - Token precedence ordering
5. **Table Cell Specifications** (1 test) - Cell spec parsing incomplete
6. **Complex Block Nesting** (1 test) - Edge case with nested conditionals  
7. **Role Span Edge Cases** (1 test) - Role names with dots

### Next Priority Order:
1. **Fix Delimited Blocks** - Implement proper external scanner fence tracking
2. **Inline Formatting Precedence** - Most failing tests, affects user experience
3. **Macro Precedence** - Important for AsciiDoc functionality  
4. **Remaining Edge Cases** - Lower impact but needed for completeness

## Technical Architecture Insights

### Key Discovery: State vs Stateless Parsing
- **Stateless Grammar Tokens**: Good for simple patterns, fixed precedence
- **Stateful External Scanner**: Required for context-dependent constructs like:
  - Balanced delimiters (fence pairs)
  - Nested structures  
  - Context-sensitive tokenization

### Design Decisions Made:
- Conditionals: Use strict grammar regex (no state needed)
- Delimited blocks: Need external scanner state (fence tracking)
- Inline elements: Grammar precedence rules should suffice
- Lists: External scanner for complex marker detection

## Recommendations for Completion

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Complete Delimited Block Fix**: 
   - Properly implement external scanner fence state tracking
   - Add specific external tokens for fence open/close state
   - Test with all delimited block types (listing, example, literal, etc.)

2. **Inline Element Precedence**:
   - Review and fix grammar precedence values for inline formatting
   - Address role span attachment and boundary issues
   - Test with complex nested formatting scenarios

3. **Systematic Testing**:
   - After each major fix, run full test suite to check for regressions
   - Focus on categories with highest test counts first
   - Ensure fixes don't break previously passing tests

### Long-term Architecture:
- **External Scanner**: For stateful constructs (fences, complex lists, conditionals)
- **Grammar Tokens**: For simple patterns with clear precedence  
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use both where appropriate, with clear separation of concerns

The project is well-structured and the systematic categorization provides a clear roadmap for completion. The successful conditional fix demonstrates that the approach is sound - it's a matter of applying similar analysis to the remaining categories.
