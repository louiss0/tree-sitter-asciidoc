# Test Failure Analysis After Parser Fixes

## Overview
After implementing major parser fixes (table fence detection, section parsing, conditional content), need to categorize test failures to determine which are:
1. **Fixed but wrong expectations** - parser now correct, tests need updating
2. **Still broken** - real parsing issues remain
3. **Regression** - previously working, now broken
