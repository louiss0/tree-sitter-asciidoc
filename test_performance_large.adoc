= Performance Test Document

== Introduction

This document contains various AsciiDoc constructs to test parsing performance:

* *Bold text* with emphasis _italic text_ 
* Code spans like `function()` and `var x = 1`
* Links like https://example.com and https://github.com[GitHub]
* Superscript E=mc^2^ and subscript H~2~O chemistry

=== Lists and More Content

1. Ordered list item with https://docs.asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc docs]
2. Another item with *bold* and _italic_ formatting
3. Third item with `code` and more ^superscript^ text

Unordered lists:

* Item with https://example.com inline link
* Another *bold item* with _emphasis_
* Final item with `code span` and ~subscript~

=== Code Blocks

----
function test() {
  return "Hello World";
}
----

=== More Complex Content

NOTE: This is an admonition with https://example.com[a link] and *formatting*.

TIP: Another admonition with `code` and _emphasis_.

==== Nested Sections

Content with inline anchor [[important-section]] for cross-references.

Reference: <<important-section,Important Section>>

External reference: xref:other.adoc[Other Document]

=== Bibliography and References  

[[[ref1]]]
Reference One: Important documentation about performance.

[[[ref2,Technical Reference]]]  
Reference Two: Technical details with description.

=== Tables

|===
|Column 1 |Column 2 |Column 3

|*Bold* cell
|Cell with https://example.com[link]  
|`code` cell

|Normal cell
|_Italic_ content
|Final cell

== Conclusion

This document tests various parsing scenarios including:

* Inline formatting: *bold*, _italic_, `code`, ^super^, ~sub~
* Links: https://example.com and https://github.com[GitHub]  
* Lists with mixed content and formatting
* Code blocks and admonitions
* Cross-references and anchors
* Bibliography entries
* Tables with formatted content

The parser should handle all these constructs efficiently.
